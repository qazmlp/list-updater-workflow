    # General format for `entries` is:
    # entries:
    #   <set>
    #
    # <set> can be different things:
    #
    # a) Union of other sets (i.e., merging them all together):
    #   union:
    #     - <set>
    #     - <set>
    #     - ...
    # b) Difference (from the left set remove entries that are in the right set):
    #   difference:
    #     left:
    #       <set>
    #     right:
    #       <set>
    # c) Literal DID:
    #   did: "did:plc:..."
    # d) Any of the number of implemented options that query Bluesky: follows,
    # followers, blocks, entries of another list, etc.
    # For the complete list see https://github.com/bsky-watch/list-updater/blob/main/schema.yaml
